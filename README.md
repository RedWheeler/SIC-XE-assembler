# csci300-assembler

This Project was developed for IUPUI's CSCI300 - Systems Programming Class(Spring 2020)

**A detailed report of my project was required for the course and is attached to this repository.**

## Project

For this project, I was tasked with developing an assembler for the fictional [SIC/XE architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Instructional_Computer).

The assembler program needed to accept an SIC/XE assembly language file and write out the assembled object code to a file.

### Supported Features:
